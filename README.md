## Notes for the Code Reviewer.
<blockquote>
I had some experience working with VueJs v2 (~1 year).
After that I stopped using it. The reason was that the company I worked choosed React as the framework for all the new projects.  
  
  
Anyway, I liked it and because it is recommended for use on this challenge, I'll use it along with NuxtJs.
I'm going to be learning Vue3 composition API and Nuxt while developing this (I never used them before). I'll be following the official documentations and using my own criteria, to create and organize the source code in the best way I can using this tech-stack.  

Furthermore, I think that working with a monorepo could make this exercise more funny. I'm planning to add an alternative client (a ReactNative app). My objective is provide you with more data about my style and abilities related to coding (particularly an example of a React application). 
I'll be using Tailwind. I think this library can help styling the UI and keeping some consistency between clients.
